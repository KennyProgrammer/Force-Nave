**Nave** is launcher for [Force Engine](https://github.com/KennyProgrammer/Force). That allows to create projects, manipulating and installing fresh builds of Force.

**NOTE:**
 Nave will be create projects on upcoming 0.4.0 version of Force, that is not released yet. When 0.4.0 will be released this is fixed automatically, so do not try create
 projects using Nave on latest 0.3.10 release (it may work or may not, only for testing).
